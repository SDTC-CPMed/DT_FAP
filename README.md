A Familial Adenomatous Polyposis-Derived Signature Predicts Sporadic Colorectal Cancer Up to a Decade in Advance, and Reveals Candidates for Early Prevention 

## Abstract
Key questions in cancer research are as follows: 1) systematically characterize and prioritize the mechanisms driving malignant transformation, and 2) find biomarkers and drug targets for early diagnosis, prevention, or treatment. We used Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) as a model for these mechanisms. FAP is a Mendelian disease characterized by hundreds of polyps and a high risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Multicellular network models from single-cell RNA sequencing data of normal and polyp tissues in FAP identified an FAP-derived signature (FdS) consisting of ten ligands and ten target genes. The translational relevance of FdS was supported by enrichment of cancer pathways. Multi-omics analyses of tissues showed associations between FdS and the different stages of FAP and CRC. Its diagnostic relevance was supported by the ability of FdS proteins in the blood to predict future CRC risk up to 14 years before diagnosis using machine learning models. The therapeutic relevance was supported by drug enrichment analysis. This showed that the most enriched drugs were clinically used to prevent or treat sporadic CRC, as well as novel candidate drugs or natural compounds with low cost and side effects. Cell line experiments supported single candidates for early treatment, and combinations for late treatment. This study demonstrates the diagnostic potential of biomarkers derived from FAP to predict future CRC and identify candidates for preventive treatment. Future studies of these biomarkers and candidates are warranted, including natural compounds with low risk and cost.
